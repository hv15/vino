For many years now I have been tasting a great many wines, but until recently
I had not thought to record my experiences of this. Over time one begins to
develop a sense for a particular grape, region, and even vintage; but I sometimes
fail to remember the name (or vintage) of a wine I tasted previously. This site
exists to hold this information, including images of the label (and bottle) as
well as a personal review.
